# Goal
AIMatrix is a benchmark suite for testing AI software frameworks and hardware platforms. It aims at providing users a means of measuring the performance of different AI sofware and hardware and comparing their pros and cons. It also helps users gain insights into the factors that affect AI hardware performance and improve hardware design.

The AIMatrix suite consists of four categories of tests: micro benchmark, layer-based benchmark, macro benchmark, and synthetic benchmark. The layer-based and macro benchmarks use tensorflow and caffe software frameworks, which are commonly used in AI applications, and are portable across a wide range of AI hardware platforms.
